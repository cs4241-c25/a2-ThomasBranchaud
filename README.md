## Games List
My application is quite straightforward. Upon opening the application there is a form that a user can use to submit a game to the database. The fields needed for this are the game's title, the genre, if the game is an online game, and the year the game was released.
After the user clicks the submit button the form will clear and the new data will be added to the database. The results table will then update to display the new game.
If the user wants to delete or modify an existing entry, they can navigate to the Update/Modify an Entry page, and follow the prompts there to make an desired changes.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I created a results portion of the main page that automatically updates upon the user entering a new entry. 
- **Tech Achievement 2**: To complete the second tech advancement I created an extra page that allows the user to choose to either update an entry or delete an entry in the database. If the user chooses to modify an entry then additional inputs will appear, showing the current data in the data base and allowing the user to input new data.
